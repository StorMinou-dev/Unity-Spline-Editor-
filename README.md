**Editor**
This project is a custom spline editor made in Unity.
It allows real-time creation and manipulation of splines
directly in the editor, using several well-known spline
algorithms based on their respective mathematical formulas.

**Spline Editing**  
You can interact with the spline by editing its control points  
and instantly visualize the result.  
The editor provides full control over spline points :

You can add new points to the spline, move existing ones,  
or delete them entirely.  
All modifications are updated in real time.

**Spline Types**  
The editor supports multiple spline types that can be  
switched at any time :  
[Spline Types Image]

Bezier Spline – Smooth curves controlled by handles.

Catmull-Rom Spline – Interpolated spline passing through each point.

B-Spline – Smooth and stable spline with local control.

Hermite Spline – Curve defined by points and tangents.

Each spline type is implemented using its corresponding  
mathematical formula to ensure accurate behavior.

**Other Informations**  
This project was made entirely by me using Unity.  
It focuses on math-driven spline implementation and  
editor tooling.
